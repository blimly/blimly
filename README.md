I go by many names. Some call me the _ThinkMart™_, the ThinkPad enthusiast.
Others refer to me as the _serverite võrgutaja_, but my hacker name is Blimly Penumbra.

I'm a software engineer currently working at a company, in Estonia.

My main interests include:
- Sustainability science
- Humane interface design
- Computational psychology
